[Binary file content - This would be a small binary file (ICO format) that represents a favicon for the website. ICO files typically contain multiple small images at different resolutions (16x16, 32x32, etc.) used as the browser tab icon. Since this is a Snake game, it would likely be a simple pixelated snake icon or a game-related symbol in green colors.]
